A. Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the process of designing,developing,testing and maintaining software.

B. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. 
    • Software engineering emphasizes testing, validation, and verification at every stage while traditional programming involve minimal testing and quality checks.
    • Software engineering encompasses the entire life-cycle of software development from requirements gathering to maintenance while traditional programming primarily focuses on writing and debugging code.

C.Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Various phases of the software development life-cycle include:
    • Requirement Analysis: Gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software from stakeholders. This phase focuses on understanding what the software should do.
    • System Design: Planning the software architecture and overall system design. This includes creating design specifications, defining system components, modules, interfaces, and data flow.
    • Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase converts design documents into a working software product.
    • Testing: Verifying that the software works as intended by identifying and fixing bugs. Various levels of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance) are conducted to ensure quality.
    • Deployment: Releasing the software to the production environment where it becomes accessible to users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training.
    • Maintenance: Ongoing updates and improvements to the software after deployment. This phase addresses any issues, adds new features, and ensures the software continues to meet user needs.

Agile vs Waterfall Model

Client input is required throughout the product development.
Client input is required only after completing each phase.
Changes can be made at any stage.
Changes cannot be made after the completion of a phase.

C. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Contrast:
    • In waterfall, planning is a linear process done at the beginning of the project, with all requirements and objectives laid out in detail upfront. In contrast, agile planning is a continuous process throughout the project's life cycle, with adjustments made as new information or requirements emerge.
    • Waterfall projects tend to take longer because all requirements must be agreed upon before development can begin. Agile projects, on the other hand, are usually delivered more rapidly than waterfall projects due to the iterative development cycles used in agile.
Compare:
    • Both Agile and Waterfall are project management methodologies
    • Both aim to deliver working software that meets the needs of the customer
    • Both rely on the participation and collaboration of all team members
Key Differences:
Agile: High flexibility, allowing changes even late in the process.
Waterfall: Low flexibility, changes are costly and difficult.
Scenarios:
Agile:
    • Projects with evolving requirements.
    • Need for rapid delivery and customer feedback.
    • High complexity and uncertainty.
Waterfall:
    • Well-defined and stable requirements.
    • Projects with regulatory compliance requiring thorough documentation.
    • Less frequent changes anticipated during development.
